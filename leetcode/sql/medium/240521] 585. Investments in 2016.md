# 240521] 585. Investments in 2016

[문제 링크](https://leetcode.com/problems/investments-in-2016/description/)

### 문제 설명
Table: Insurance  

| Column Name | Type  |
|-------------|-------|
| pid         | int   |
| tiv_2015    | float |
| tiv_2016    | float |
| lat         | float |
| lon         | float |

pid is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.  
Each row of this table contains information about one policy where:  
pid is the policyholder's policy ID.  
tiv_2015 is the total investment value in 2015 and tiv_2016 is the total investment value in 2016.  
lat is the latitude of the policy holder's city. It's guaranteed that lat is not NULL.  
lon is the longitude of the policy holder's city. It's guaranteed that lon is not NULL.  
 

Write a solution to report the sum of all total investment values in 2016 `tiv_2016`, for all policyholders who:  

* have the same `tiv_2015` value as one or more other policyholders, and
* are not located in the same city as any other policyholder (i.e., the (`lat`, `lon`) attribute pairs must be unique).

Round `tiv_2016` to **two decimal places**.  

The result format is in the following example.  

### 풀이
```sql
select round(sum(tiv_2016), 2) as tiv_2016
from Insurance
where tiv_2015 in (
    select tiv_2015
    from Insurance
    group by tiv_2015
    having count(*) > 1
)
and (lat, lon) in (
    select lat, lon
    from Insurance
    group by lat, lon
    having count(*) < 2
)
```

## 참고
count(~) over(partition by ~)  
`<>` == `!=`

      tiv_2016,
      COUNT(*) OVER(PARTITION by tiv_2015) AS tiv_2015_count,
      COUNT(*) OVER(PARTITION by lat, lon) AS city_count
    FROM Insurance
  )
SELECT ROUND(SUM(tiv_2016), 2) AS tiv_2016
FROM InsuranceWithCounts
WHERE tiv_2015_count > 1
  AND city_count = 1
```

WHERE EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 
        FROM Insurance i2 
        WHERE i1.tiv_2015 = i2.tiv_2015 AND i1.pid <> i2.pid 
    ) 
AND NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM Insurance i3
        WHERE i1.lat = i3.lat AND i1.lon = i3.lon AND i1.pid <> i3.pid
    )
```
