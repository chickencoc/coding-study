[문제 링크](https://leetcode.com/problems/managers-with-at-least-5-direct-reports/description/)

### 문제 설명
Table: Employee  

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| department  | varchar |
| managerId   | int     |

id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.  
Each row of this table indicates the name of an employee, their department, and the id of their manager.  
If managerId is null, then the employee does not have a manager.  
No employee will be the manager of themself.

Return the result table in any order.  

The result format is in the following example.  

### 풀이
```sql
SELECT NAME
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE ID IN (
    SELECT MANAGERID
    FROM EMPLOYEE
    GROUP BY MANAGERID
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5
)
```
