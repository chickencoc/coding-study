# 240610] 1051. Height Checker

[문제 링크](https://leetcode.com/problems/height-checker/description/)

### 문제 설명
A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file line in non-decreasing order by height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer array expected where expected[i] is the expected height of the i<sup>th</sup> student in line.  

You are given an integer array heights representing the current order that the students are standing in. Each heights[i] is the height of the i<sup>th</sup> student in line (0-indexed).  

Return the number of indices where heights[i] != expected[i].   

**제한 사항**  
* 1 <= heights.length <= 100
* 1 <= heights[i] <= 100

### 풀이
```java
class Solution {
    public int heightChecker(int[] heights) {
        int answer = 0;
        int[] expected = heights.clone();
        Arrays.sort(expected);

        for(int i = 0; i < heights.length; i++) {
            if(expected[i] != heights[i]) {
                answer++;
            }
        }

        return answer;
    }
}
```
